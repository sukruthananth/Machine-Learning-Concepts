# Machine-Learning-Concepts

The files are named based on the concepts

These are jupyter files. But can also be run on Pycharm by just copying the code 

Need to install Scipy, Numpy, Pandas libraries to go deep into machine learning concepts

finally Feature Engineering is very important as it establishes a base on how a machine learning algorithm is run in real life problems
